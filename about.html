            It’s not every day that you meet the CEO of a public company who is
            also a world-renowned Beatleologist. The creator of software that
            transformed two industries and the creator and presenter of nine
            acclaimed documentary films. A seasoned executive who holds multiple
            patents - as comfortable with investors as with sales and product
            teams – and a former Yale professor.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not every day that you meet <strong>Scott Freiman</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scott Freiman is a technology and e-business savvy senior executive
            and entrepreneur with extensive expertise in strategy, marketing,
            technology, and operations. He may be the only person to have sold
            out Carnegie Hall and been a Finalist for Ernst and Young’s
            Entrepreneur of the Year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Freiman was co-founder and CEO of Credit Management Solutions,
            Inc. (formerly NASDAQ:CMSS), a publicly traded financial software
            and services company and one of the earliest e-business successes.
            Mr. Freiman co-founded Credit Management Solutions in 1987 shortly
            after graduating from Yale University with a B.S. in Computer
            Science and Music.
          </p>
          <p>
            After selling CMSI, Mr. Freiman became a full-time composer and
            producer. Mr. Freiman composed music for more than ten films, and
            also acted as sound editor and mixer on many films. Mr. Freiman also
            built Second Act Studio, a state-of-the-art music and video studio
            for composition, recording, and production.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2009, Mr. Freiman created Deconstructing the Beatles
            (beatleslectures.com), a series of multimedia presentations about
            the composition and production techniques of the Beatles. Mr.
            Freiman has presented his lectures to sold-out audiences at theaters
            nationwide and has spoken about the Beatles at colleges,
            universities, and corporations, such as Pixar, Google, and Facebook.
            In the Fall of 2012, Mr. Freiman taught a semester course on “The
            Beatles In The Studio” at Yale University. Mr. Freiman’s insights
            into the music of the Beatles can be found in the book All the
            Songs: The Story Behind Every Beatles Release published in October
            2013 by Black Dog and Leventhal. Mr. Freiman is featured in eleven
            Deconstructing the Beatles films currently showing in theatres
            throughout North America and available on DVD and streaming.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2013, Mr. Freiman co-founded Qwire Inc. The company’s software is
            being used to streamline music tracking and rights management for
            television series, films and other media. A strong advocate for
            music education for children, Mr. Freiman has taught composing and
            music technology to children and adults and created over 30 video
            training courses for AskAudio.com.
